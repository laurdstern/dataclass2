# Creating and Embedding a Data Viz

Data Story: Class Enrollment Getting more women into technical roles is an ongoing effort for many organizations that target young girls to get them excited about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. As the popularity and reach of these organizations grows, more women enter the tech world or volunteer to learn about tech; this is reflected in the class, where more women who have grown up with the Women in STEM push (beginning about 1985) are enrolled in the class.

*Note: these totals do not include data where the birthdate or gender field were left blank, or where the birthdate was improbable (e.g., 2016, 1895).*
